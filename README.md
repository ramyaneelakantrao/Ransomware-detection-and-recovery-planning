Designed a machine learning-based predictive model that could help in the development of better ransomware detection and recovery methods. Applied Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines on a dataset of over 62,000 instances to determine early signs of ransomware action. Performed extensive preprocessing of data, feature engineering, and model evaluation to ensure high accuracy in ransomware detection. Employed visualization techniques to study trends and model performance. It also explored recovery planning strategies as a measure to cut downtime and protect business continuity, further fortifying cybersecurity resilience against these emerging ransomware threats.
